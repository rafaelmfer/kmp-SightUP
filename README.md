# This is a Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS.

## Before running!
- check your system with [KDoctor](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor)
- install JDK 17 or higher on your machine
- add `local.properties` file to the project root and set a path to Android SDK there

### Android
To run the application on android device/emulator:
- open project in Android Studio and run imported android run configuration

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code that’s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple’s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

* `/iosApp` contains iOS applications. Even if you’re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform, 
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

To build the application bundle:
- run `./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug`
- find `.apk` file in `composeApp/build/outputs/apk/debug/composeApp-debug.apk`
  Run android UI tests on the connected device: `./gradlew :composeApp:connectedDebugAndroidTest`

### iOS
To run the application on iPhone device/simulator:
- Open `iosApp/iosApp.xcproject` in Xcode and run standard configuration
- Or use [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile) for Android Studio
  Run iOS simulator UI tests: `./gradlew :composeApp:iosSimulatorArm64Test`
